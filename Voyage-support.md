## FAQ
**Why don’t I see places right away?**  
Sometimes MapKit returns slowly or there are few results for a niche filter. Try switching distance or category, or tap **Try again**.

**Can I change my start city?**  
Yes — tap **Edit** in the header, type a city (e.g., Seattle, WA), and **Save**. You can also **Use Current Location**.

**What permissions do you need?**  
Location permission is requested only when you tap **Use Current Location**.

## Troubleshooting
- If Discover looks empty, pull to refresh and try **Parks** or **Tourist**.
- Toggle between **<20mi** and **20+mi** and tap **Try again**.
- Reinstalling? Your saved itinerary is stored on your device (no account needed).

## Release Notes
